# Exporters

---

Cabourotte is able to export healthchecks results to external systems using exporters. Exporters names should be unique.

Note that the Prometheus endpoint also provides counters for healthchecks results and the healthchecks execution time. You can find more information about the Prometheus integration and available metrics in the [monitoring](/installation/monitoring/) section.
